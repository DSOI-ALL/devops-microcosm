See [below](#attributes) for more details. Hubot instances are\nconfigured using environment variables passed to the Hubot process. These\nenvironment variables can be set using the `node['hubot']['config']` attribute.\n\nI hightly recommend integrating this cookbook into your own infrastruce using\nthe\n[library/application cookbook pattern](http://devopsanywhere.blogspot.com/2012/11/how-to-write-reusable-chef-cookbooks.html).\nYou would start by creating a `YOURCOMPANY-hubot` cookbook with a proper\nmetadata depedency on the `hubot` (this) cookbook. A concrete example can be\nfound [on this gist](https://gist.github.com/schisamo/46eafba27d43c4a1e026)\nwhich was created from bits of the internal `opscode-hubot` cookbook which we\nuse to deploy, Paula Deen, Opscode's hubot instance.\n\nOne important item to note is the use of the\n[remote_directory](http://docs.opscode.com/resource_remote_directory.html)\nresource to distribute our internal hubot scripts to the install:\n\n```ruby\nremote_directory \"#{node['hubot']['install_dir']}/scripts\" do\n  source \"scripts\"\n  files_backup 0\n  files_owner node['hubot']['user']\n  files_group node['hubot']['group']\n  files_mode '0644'\n  owner node['hubot']['user']\n  group node['hubot']['group']\n  overwrite true\n  mode '0755'\n  notifies :restart, \"service[hubot]\", :delayed\nend\n```\n\n# Requirements\n\n## Chef\n\nTested on Chef 11/12\n\n## Platform\n\nThe following platforms have been tested with this cookbook, meaning that the\nrecipes and LWRPs run on these platforms without error:\n\n* Ubuntu 10.04+\n* RHEL/Centos 6\n\n## Cookbooks\n\nThis cookbook depends on the following external cookbooks:\n\n* [nodejs](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/nodejs)\n* [git](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/git)\n* [runit](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/runit)\n* [supervisor](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/supervisor)\n\n# Recipes\n\n## default\n\n* Ensures that Node.js is installed and available using the\n  [nodejs cookbook](http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/nodejs).\n* Ensures git is installed and available using the\n  [git cookbook](http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/git).\n* Ensures runit is installed and available using the\n  [runit cookbook](http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/runit).\n* Creates a user and group to install and run the Hubot instance under.\n* Installs the specified Hubot version from git.\n* Renders instance-specific `package.json`, `external-scripts.json`, `hubot-scripts.json`, and\n `hubot.conf` files.\n* Creates and enables a `hubot` runit service to run the Hubot instance under.\n  The runit service reads the `hubot.conf` file and passes the contents onto\n  the underlying hubot process as configuraiton.\n\n# Attributes\n\nAttribute       | Description |Type | Default\n----------------|-------------|-----|--------\nversion         | Hubot version to install. | String  | 2.11.0      |\nscripts_version | Version of [hubot-scripts](https://github.com/github/hubot-scripts) (community collection of hubot scripts) to install. | String | 2.5.16\ninstall_dir     | Directory the Hubot instance will be installed to. | String | /opt/hubot\nuser            | The user to install and run the Hubot instance under. | String | hubot\ngroup           | The group to install and run the Hubot instance under. | String | hubot\nname            | The name of the robot in chat. | String | hubot\nadapter         | The [Hubot adapter](https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/docs/adapters.md) to use. | String | campfire\nconfig          | Hash of values that will be converted into environment variables and passed to the Hubot process. | Hash | Hash.new\ndependencies    | Hash in form `dep_name => dep_version` that will be rendered into Hubot instance's `package.json`. A common dep to set in this attribute is non-Campfire adapters. | Hash | Hash.new\nhubot_scripts   | Scripts to enable from the [community collection of hubot scripts](https://github.com/github/hubot-scripts). | Array | Array.new\nexternal_scripts| External scripts to enable. | Array | Array.new\n\n# Testing\n\nThis cookbook ships with full support for the new alpha version of Opscode's\n`test-kitchen`. [Fletcher Nichol's](https://github.com/fnichol) excellent Jamie\nintegration test runner was\n[recently merged into the test-kitchen codebase](http://lists.opscode.com/sympa/arc/chef-dev/2013-01/msg00038.html).\nThis merge and all new feature work are now taking place in the\n[1.0 branch of test-kitchen](https://github.com/opscode/test-kitchen/tree/1.0).\nEven though many community members have been dogfooding the new `test-kitchen`\ncodebase and it has proven quite stable, it should still be regarded as\npre-release code and YMMV.\n\nRunning integration with test-kitchen is easy. First we'll assume you have a\nsane cookbook development toolchain installed which includes:\n\n* Git\n* Ruby 1.9.x\n* Bundler\n* VirtualBox 4.x\n\nIf you need help setting up this toolchain, take a read through the\n\"[System Setup](http://vialstudios.com/guide-authoring-cookbooks.html#system_setup)\"\nsection of [Jamie Winsor's](https://github.com/reset) excellent cookbook\nauthoring guide.\n\nFirst install all gem dependencies with Bundler:\n\n```shell\n$ bundle install --binstubs\n```\n\nBundler will install all of the dependent RubyGems and guarantee that you have\nthe right versions. Now it's time to get your test on:\n\n```shell\n$ bundle exec kitchen test\n```\n\nThis command will do the following across every platform/version this cookbook\nsupports:\n\n* Use Vagrant to provision a platform-specific VM.\n* Add a `recipe[hubot]` entry to the instance's run_list.\n* Converge the VM with `chef-solo`.\n\nBy default, any VM that successfully converges will automaticallly be cleaned\nup. The full set of `kitchen` subcommands can be viewed by running:\n\n```shell\n$ bundle exec kitchen help\n```\n\n# Development\n\n* Source hosted at [GitHub][repo]\n* Report issues/Questions/Feature requests on [GitHub Issues][issues]\n\nI <3 pull requests!
